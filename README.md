# simpleWebsiteMonitor

A simple website monitor based on scrapy and mongodb.

It should be able to monitor:
1.Whether a set of webpages is accessible.
2.Whether the links of a set of webpages is accessible.
3.Whether there is new content added.
4.The monitoring log should be easy to obtain (for example, through a monitor web service).
